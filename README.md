# AskieForum

The current database is at http://askieforum.herokuapp.com for now

If it is not up, then download the files to a directory.

This must all be done on a local machine!

Run: "npm install" inside the directory where server.js is located.
    If it errors, then try it again.

After that Run: "npm start" and it should work.

Go to localhost:3001 in your favorite search engine (not an old version)

Then navigate the unfinished website. :)



We tried to make viewing what we have easier with some temperary links.  

If you would like to manuver them manually, type these after http://askieforum.herokuapp.com (or localhost:3001 if you ran it locally)


The pages are:
    /				- Index Page
    /login			- Login Page
    /home			- User Home Page
    /settings		- User Settings (not started yet)
    /signup			- SignUp Page
    /member-forum	- Member Forum Layout
    /host-forum		- Host Forum Layout (not started yet)

   	EverythingElse  - Should be 404 page not found error


If you have any difficulty, let us know so we can make the site layout better!
